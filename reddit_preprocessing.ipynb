From what I've learned it's completely dependent on using Bing's Dalle rather than let's say OpenAi's version (someone can probably clarify why, something about the training model being different) which allows you to render out these amazing 80's style anime shots. Here are some shots and the prompts, hope you enjoy them.\\n\\nI added the corresponding titles for the prompts here. You'll notice that I'm mostly switching out the last part where it's the scene, the first part is the style, and then some filters. Its super important to keep the artist in mind. And with that, I'd like to thank all of the hardworking artists who made this all even possible.\\n\\n**Yoshiyuki Sadamoto <3**\\n\\n**Rumiko Takahashi <3**\\n\\n**Prompts:**\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*Lady in the Circuits:\\n\\nStyle of **Rumiko Takahas\",\n          \"Which technologies should I focus on to increase my chances of landing an internship?

From what I've learned it's completely dependent on using Bing's Dalle rather than let's say OpenAi's version (someone can probably clarify why, something about the training model being different) which allows you to render out these amazing 80's style anime shots. Here are some shots and the prompts, hope you enjoy them.\\n\\nI added the corresponding titles for the prompts here. You'll notice that I'm mostly switching out the last part where it's the scene, the first part is the style, and then some filters. Its super important to keep the artist in mind.

From what I've learned it's completely dependent on using Bing's Dalle rather than let's say OpenAi's version (someone can probably clarify why, something about the training model being different) which allows you to render out these amazing 80's style anime shots. Here are some shots and the prompts, hope you enjoy them.\\n\\nI added the corresponding titles for the prompts here. You'll notice that I'm mostly switching out the last part where it's the scene, the first part is the style, and then some filters. Its super important to keep the artist in mind. And with that, I'd like to thank all of the hardworking artists who made this all even possible.\\n\\n**Yoshiyuki Sadamoto <3**\\n\\n**Rumiko Takahashi <3**\\n\\n**Prompts:**\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*Lady in the Circuits:\\n\\nStyle of **Rumiko Takahas\",\n          \"Which technologies should I focus on to increase my chances of landing an internship?
